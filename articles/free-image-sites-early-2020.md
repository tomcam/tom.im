# Free Image Sites, Early 2020 edition

You need some great clip art but have a budget of $0. You may even be working
for  a commercial organization. Where do you go? Here's a list
of websites that provide free images, even for commercial use---with
a few exceptions, discussed below.

## Free images for commercial use

[StockSnap.io](https://stocksnap.io/) is in serious growth mode and has
unusually generous licensing. Its images are in the public domain, which
means you can do anything you want with them, including resell on 
posters, T-shirts, coffee mugs, whatever.

[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) is a fan favorite, with some particularly 
high quality images and a good way of crediting its creators.

[Taken Photos](https://taken.photos) acquires hundreds of photos a day, using machine
learning to label them. [Their license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) 
is CC0, which means you can use the images with no restriction 
(but they aren't model released).

[freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) has a good search engine (before to choose Free),
and has a strong emphasis on vector images as well as photos. Not sure why the vector
images default to .EPS format, however.

## Free cartoons for commercial use

* [Open Doodles](https://www.opendoodles.com) wins the coveted "funkiest free image site" award 
in this roundup with its very specific, literally cartoonish sensibility. It's also one of
the most flexible, because their [Generator](https://generator.opendoodles.com) lets you
design a color scheme for the images.

* [Comicgen](https://gramener.com/comicgen/) from [Gramener](https://gramener.com/) is a 
close competitor to [Open Doodles](https://www.opendoodles.com)
in the funkiness sweepstakes.

## Beware of model releases

I was able to verify that one site requires model releases. That's [Freerange Stock](https://freerangestock.com) 
Now you know why theres only one picture in this article featuring a person with a recognizable face!

## Adding credit

## There's always catch, but this one isn't too bad

When *can't* you use this images? 

**Collections** Most, though not all, only have problem with your using the image
in the case where you are competiting with the sites themselves. 
In other words, don't stockpile copies of all their images and try to start a competiting site.
The license terms on the images normally forbid such use.

**Reselling** You probably aren't allowed to use these images on things you resell in bulk,
for example, T-shirts or coffee mugs. Check the license terms on each site to be sure.
For example, anything using [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) 
licensing is without any restriction.
## Your Free Image Usage Checklist

* If there's a recognizable face, was a model release done?
* If credit is required, did you include it? Remember that a direct link may be needed
* Is the image actually available for commercial usage? At time of writing all the sites here
allow it, unless you are bundling huge sets of these images to build a competing site.
