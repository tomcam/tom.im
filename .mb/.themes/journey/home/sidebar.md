## ABOUT SOPU QI

![Picture of Sopu Qi](sopu-qi-256x256.jpg)

I'm Sopu Qi, and I'm fascinated by the
idea of owning my own place in the country.
I grew up in a rural home. I tried Seattle
and didn't like it much, but I like that
part of the country. It's my goal to
live in the country with at least 2 
chickens and maybe a couple capybaras.
Since I don't want to make too many
mistakes with the biggest purchase of
my life I'm keeping track of the things
I've learned about buying rural land,
mobile homes, modular homes, tiny homes,
and other ways to keep from paying
$1 million for my own home in the Seattle area.
